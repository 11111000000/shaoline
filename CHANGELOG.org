#+TITLE: Shaoline – Change Log

* 2.1.1 (Functional enlightenment & persistent center)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: v2.1.1
  :END:

- Release date: 2025-07-20
- Persistent center: last non-empty message now truly persists until a new non-empty arrives (see FAQ).
- Multi-line message truncation in center segment improved ([more] indicator).
- Enhanced TTY-fallback (Unicode/icons).
- Complete ERT/CI test suite, lint and performance coverage.
- Documentation: persistent-center, configuration, MELPA/ELPA section clarified.
- Internal cleanups: no superfluous timers/messages; error handling improved in segment core.
- Version unification across all files.
- Compatible with Emacs 27.1+.

* 2.1.0 (First public release – The Modeline of Nothingness)

- Initial release to MELPA/ELPA.
- Pure functional core: all segments are pure functions; no side effects outside echo-area rendering.
- Minimalist echo-area modeline: replaces the classic mode-line with a single echo line.
- /Persistent center/: shows the last non-empty message until a new one arrives (see FAQ).
- No polling timers unless you enable time or battery segments (truely minimal).
- /Debounced updates/: rapid commands = a single smooth repaint (no flicker).
- Optional global hiding of the classic mode-line (configurable).
- No required dependencies – projectile, all-the-icons, etc. load lazily if present.
- Unicode and TTY support (graceful icon and moon phase degradation).
- Easy segment customization with macros (see README and examples/custom-segments.el).
- Includes ERT test suite and GitHub Actions/CI workflow.
- DZен commentary and humour.

/Walk the Way. Drink tea. Material modelines are emptiness; emptiness is a perfect modeline./
