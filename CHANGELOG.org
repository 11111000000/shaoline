#+TITLE: Shaoline – Change Log

* 2.1.0 (First public release – The Modeline of Nothingness)

- Initial release to MELPA/ELPA.
- Pure functional core: all segments are pure functions; no side effects outside echo-area rendering.
- Minimalist echo-area modeline: replaces the classic mode-line with a single echo line.
- /Persistent center/: shows the last non-empty message until a new one arrives (see FAQ).
- No polling timers unless you enable time or battery segments (truely minimal).
- /Debounced updates/: rapid commands = a single smooth repaint (no flicker).
- Optional global hiding of the classic mode-line (configurable).
- No required dependencies – projectile, all-the-icons, etc. load lazily if present.
- Unicode and TTY support (graceful icon and moon phase degradation).
- Easy segment customization with macros (see README and examples/custom-segments.el).
- Includes ERT test suite and GitHub Actions/CI workflow.
- DZен commentary and humour.

/Walk the Way. Drink tea. Material modelines are emptiness; emptiness is a perfect modeline./
