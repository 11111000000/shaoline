TITLE: Shaoline – Change Log
* 2.3.0 (Async Firefly & Core Harmony)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: v2.3.0
  :END:

- Release date: 2025-07-28
- Implemented asynchronous loading for battery segment using `async-start` (non-blocking, with "Batt..." placeholder during computation).
- Simplified architecture: merged `shaoline-macros.el` and `shaoline-msg-engine.el` into core `shaoline.el`; deleted separate files.
- Removed deprecated alias `shaoline-segment-time` (use `shaoline-segment-digital-clock` instead).
- Expanded tests in `shaoline-core-test.el` to cover async battery behavior.
- Updated README.org and README.ru.org to reflect async battery and new simplifications.
- Version bump: 2.3.0.

* 2.2.2 (Cache of Still Waters)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: v2.2.2
  :END:

- Release date: 2025-07-24
- Heavy segments (project-name, battery) are now TTL-cached by default via the new macro `shaoline-define-cached-segment`.
- Macro added to `shaoline-macros.el`; developers can wrap any I/O-bound segment with one line of code.
- Typical keystroke CPU usage drops by an order of magnitude.
- No configuration breakage; behaviour identical, only faster.
- Version bump: 2.2.2.

* 2.2.1 (Hooks Untangled & Stillness Always-visible)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: v2.2.1
  :END:

- Release date: 2025-07-23
- Major code refactor: all side effects (advice, hooks, timers) are now managed in new `shaoline-events.el`.
- Core and infrastructure remain pure and testable—no more accidental circular dependencies.
- New customizable option: `shaoline-always-visible`. When enabled (default), Shaoline remains visible in echo area even when user `message`s are issued—messages persist in the center until actively dismissed.
- Segment arrangement updated: right side now starts with position, then project, VCS, battery, input-method, time, and moon (see README).
- Documentation overhaul: README and Russian README reflect architecture split, new user workflow, `always-visible` option.
- Internal API changes: infra delegates all hooks/advice/timers to `shaoline-events`.
- All user-visible behaviour remains stable; configuration is backwards compatible.
- This sets the ground for further event-driven/extensible mechanisms.
- Version bump: 2.2.1.


* 2.1.1 (Functional enlightenment & persistent center)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: v2.1.1
  :END:

- Release date: 2025-07-20
- Persistent center: last non-empty message now truly persists until a new non-empty arrives (see FAQ).
- Multi-line message truncation in center segment improved ([more] indicator).
- Enhanced TTY-fallback (Unicode/icons).
- Complete ERT/CI test suite, lint and performance coverage.
- Documentation: persistent-center, configuration, MELPA/ELPA section clarified.
- Internal cleanups: no superfluous timers/messages; error handling improved in segment core.
- Version unification across all files.
- Compatible with Emacs 27.1+.

* 2.1.0 (First public release – The Modeline of Nothingness)

- Initial release to MELPA/ELPA.
- Pure functional core: all segments are pure functions; no side effects outside echo-area rendering.
- Minimalist echo-area modeline: replaces the classic mode-line with a single echo line.
- /Persistent center/: shows the last non-empty message until a new one arrives (see FAQ).
- No polling timers unless you enable time or battery segments (truely minimal).
- /Debounced updates/: rapid commands = a single smooth repaint (no flicker).
- Optional global hiding of the classic mode-line (configurable).
- No required dependencies – projectile, all-the-icons, etc. load lazily if present.
- Unicode and TTY support (graceful icon and moon phase degradation).
- Easy segment customization with macros (see README and examples/custom-segments.el).
- Includes ERT test suite and GitHub Actions/CI workflow.
- DZен commentary and humour.

/Walk the Way. Drink tea. Material modelines are emptiness; emptiness is a perfect modeline./
