- Taoline: The Lightest Line — Functional Minimalism for Emacs

In true equilibrium, nothing superfluous is required — and Taoline manifests but that which truly occupies thy attention in the present moment. This modeline flits into the echo area only when it has aught to impart, then vanishes without trace, as a silent brook flowing by.

* What doth Taoline?

- Sheweth only what is needful — in the very moment and at the foot of the window (echo area).
- Her architecture resteth upon pure functions: each segment doth commune with the buffer, disturbing not the global state.
- Simplicity is esteemed above all: segments may be added, transposed, or omitted with the lightest touch.
- Her configuration is intuitive — transparent unto any who cast their gaze upon Emacs for the first occasion.
- Bereft of timers: renewal occurreth gently, solely upon morrowings of thine own action.

* The Initial Step

To summon Taoline unto thy presence, proceed thusly:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package taoline
  :ensure t
  :config
  (taoline-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

To enable Taoline:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(taoline-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

* The Art of Personalisation: The Dance of Segments

All segments assemble within the list =taoline-segments=. Each is scribed as a pure function (buffer → string):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq taoline-segments
      '((:left taoline-segment-icon-and-buffer taoline-segment-git-branch)
        (:center taoline-segment-echo-message)
        (:right taoline-segment-project-name taoline-segment-time)))
#+END_SRC

To alter the sequence, or to add or remove segments, simply edit this list. The left (:left), central (:center), and right (:right) divisions — amongst them space shall arise as necessity demandeth.

* The Meditation on Extension: How To Fashion Thine Own Segment

Each portion of Taoline is a solitary function, entwined neither with others nor with the wide world. To create a new segment is but the work of a single comma:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(taoline-define-segment taoline-segment-buffer-size (buffer)
  "Displayeth the magnitude of the buffer."
  (format "%.1fK" (/ (buffer-size buffer) 1024.0)))
#+END_SRC

Then place it within the chosen quarter:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(push 'taoline-segment-buffer-size (alist-get :right taoline-segments))
#+END_SRC

* Permit the Echo Area to Flow Peacefully

Taoline revealeth herself in the echo area only when no other message is present. All matters of weightier import — be it the minibuffer, an isearch, or thine own dispatches — possess priority. The customary modeline is obscured (shouldst thou so desire — this behaviour is optional).

* Frequent Inquiries

- /Wherefore is my mode-line vanished?/  
  It hath absented itself in homage to the Void. It shall reappear when =taoline-mode= is disabled.

- /Wherefore doth the message of Taoline at times vanish suddenly?/  
  When Emacs is otherwise engaged — emitting its own notifications or contending with the minibuffer — Taoline courteously yieldeth precedence.

- /How might I add whatsoever pleases me?/  
  Simply compose a function (buffer) → string, register it using =taoline-define-segment=, and implant the symbol of this function whither thou wilt in the segments’ list.

* Where May the Art of Taoline Be Studied?

Peruse the source, or behold [GitHub](https://github.com/11111000000/taoline) — there all is plain and possessed of utmost clarity. Logs of her proceedings (shouldst thou require them) reside in the buffer =*taoline-logs*=.
