- Taoline: The Lightest Line — Functional Minimalism for Emacs

In perfect equilibrium, nothing superfluous is required; Taoline therefore presents only what truly merits your attention in the present moment. The modeline appears in the echo area only when it has something to say, then slips away without a trace, like a silent brook.

* What Does Taoline Do?

- Displays only what is necessary—at the precise moment and at the foot of the window (the echo area).
- Its architecture is built upon pure functions: each segment communicates solely with the current buffer, leaving global state untouched.
- Simplicity is held paramount: segments may be added, reordered, or removed with the lightest touch.
- Configuration is intuitive—clear even to those beholding Emacs for the first time.
- Free of timers: updates occur gently, only in response to your own actions.

* The First Step

To summon Taoline, proceed as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package taoline
  :ensure t
  :config
  (taoline-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

To enable Taoline directly:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(taoline-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

* Personalisation: The Dance of Segments

All segments assemble in the list `taoline-segments`. Each is a pure function (buffer → string):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq taoline-segments
      '((:left   taoline-segment-icon-and-buffer taoline-segment-git-branch)
        (:center taoline-segment-echo-message)
        (:right  taoline-segment-project-name   taoline-segment-time)))
#+END_SRC

To alter the order, or to add or remove segments, simply edit this list. The left (`:left`), centre (`:center`), and right (`:right`) divisions will insert space between themselves as required.

* Extending Taoline: Crafting Your Own Segment

Each portion of Taoline is an independent function, coupled neither to other segments nor to global state. Creating a new segment is as simple as writing one function:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(taoline-define-segment taoline-segment-buffer-size (buffer)
  "Display the size of the current buffer."
  (format "%.1f K" (/ (buffer-size buffer) 1024.0)))
#+END_SRC

Then place it in the desired slot:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(push 'taoline-segment-buffer-size (alist-get :right taoline-segments))
#+END_SRC

* Let the Echo Area Flow Unhindered

Taoline reveals itself in the echo area only when no other message is present. All matters of greater import—such as the minibuffer, an incremental search, or your own messages—take precedence. The traditional modeline can be hidden (this behaviour is optional).

* Frequently Asked Questions

- /Where has my modeline gone?/  
  It has withdrawn in homage to the Void. It will return when `taoline-mode` is disabled.

- /Why does the Taoline message sometimes vanish unexpectedly?/  
  When Emacs is busy—emitting its own notifications or occupying the minibuffer—Taoline courteously yields the floor.

- /How may I add whatever I please?/  
  Write a function `(buffer) → string`, register it with `taoline-define-segment`, and insert its symbol at the desired position in the segment list.

* Where May One Study the Art of Taoline?

Peruse the source code or visit [GitHub](https://github.com/11111000000/taoline); all is plain and uncommonly clear. Logs of Taoline’s activity (should you require them) reside in the buffer `*taoline-logs*`.
