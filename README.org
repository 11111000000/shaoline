There was an age when every buffer wore a heavy belt of glyphs, numbers, and blinking widgets.  
Then, a simple Lisp script shaved its head, took its place in the echo area, and simply /was/.  
That file is *Shaoline*.

Shaoline replaces the traditional mode-line with a minimalist, highly functional string presented only in the echo area.  
It disappears the moment Emacs needs to speak, or remains if you wish.  
It does /just enough/ and then /nothing more/.  
To walk its Dao, do nothing; all gets done.

#+begin_quote
“When nothing is done, nothing remains undone.”

* Quick Start

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package shaoline
  :ensure t
  :config
  (shaoline-mode 1))
#+end_src

Ready? Ignore the rest.  
Curious? Let insight flow further.

* Features — Reflections of Emptiness

1. /Echo-area only/ — no child frames, windows, overlays.
2. /Functional core/ — all segments are pure functions: input → string.
3. /Zero timers unless truly needed/ — time or battery segments trigger timers, nothing else.
4. /Debounced updates/ — multiple triggers collapse into a single, smooth repaint.
5. /Optional mode-line hiding/ — see the void if you wish.
6. /Zero dependencies required/ — icons, battery, project, et al., only if chosen.
7. /Unit-test friendly/ — core composer is pure and side-effect free.
8. /Persistent center/ — the last non-empty message remains until a new one comes.
9. /Chan humor/ — a hint of Zen trickster may appear.
10. /Always-visible option/ — anchor under your code, even during (message ...).

* Installation

** GNU ELPA / MELPA
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x package-install RET shaoline RET
#+end_src

** Other Ways (Straight/Quelpa/Git)
Clone and add to ~load-path~, or use your favorite package manager.  
Requires Emacs 27.1 or later.

* Philosophy ⇒ Configuration

Shaoline’s default setup fits most needs, but the Dao is personal — customize your segments as your path suggests.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq shaoline-segments
      '((:left   shaoline-segment-major-mode-icon
                 shaoline-segment-buffer-name
                 shaoline-segment-modified
                 shaoline-segment-minor-modes)
        (:center shaoline-segment-echo-message)
        (:right  shaoline-segment-position
                 shaoline-segment-project-name
                 shaoline-segment-git-branch
                 shaoline-segment-battery
                 shaoline-segment-input-method
                 shaoline-segment-digital-clock
                 shaoline-segment-moon-phase)))
#+end_src

Each section (:left, :center, :right) is fully customizable.

| Variable                         | Default | Description                                                      |
|----------------------------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| shaoline-enable-dynamic-segments | t       | Disable to drop timers & external segments (e.g. time, battery)  |
| shaoline-timer-interval          | 1       | Seconds between periodic refreshes (timer starts only if needed) |
| shaoline-always-visible          | t       | Keep modeline visible, even during (message ...)                 |
| shaoline-enable-hooks            | t       | If nil, disables all update hooks — only manual refreshes happen |
| shaoline-attach-advices          | t       | If nil, never adds advices (for message/warning interception)    |
| shaoline-attach-hooks            | t       | If nil, never adds/removes hooks automatically                   |
| shaoline-message-timeout         | 10      | Seconds to wait before shaoline redraw after a message           |
| shaoline-project-name-ttl        | 2       | TTL (sec) for caching project name, reduces disk I/O             |
| shaoline-battery-ttl             | 5       | TTL (sec) for caching battery status/level                       |
| shaoline-autohide-modeline       | t       | Hide the traditional mode-line while Shaoline is active          |
| shaoline-exclude-modes           | list    | Modes in which to *not* hide classic mode-line                     |
| shaoline-update-hooks            | list    | Hooks which trigger repaint                                      |
| shaoline-right-padding           | 0       | Extra spaces added at the right                                  |
| shaoline-debug                   | nil     | Enable logs in //shaoline-logs//                                   |

Customize interactively:  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x customize-group RET shaoline RET
#+end_src

/Total Control: “Wu Wei” (do not, let flow)/  
For complete purity, disable everything side-effectful:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq shaoline-enable-hooks nil
      shaoline-always-visible nil
      shaoline-enable-dynamic-segments nil
      shaoline-attach-advices nil
      shaoline-attach-hooks nil)
(shaoline-mode 1)
(global-set-key (kbd "<f8>") #'shaoline--update)
#+end_src

To remove all traces after experimenting:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(shaoline-purge-infra)
#+end_src

* TTL (Time-To-Live) Cache for Heavier Segments

Segments like the project name and battery level may be slow to compute, so they're TTL-cached (defaults: 2s and 5s).

- Customize via =M-x customize-group RET shaoline-caching RET=
- To get an immediate uncached value for testing:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(shaoline--segment-project-name-raw)
(shaoline--segment-battery-raw)
#+end_src

* Standard Segments

| Symbol                         | Description                               | Requires               |
|--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+------------------------|
| shaoline-segment-position      | Line and column                           | —                      |
| shaoline-segment-modified      | “*” if buffer is modified                 | —                      |
| shaoline-segment-echo-message  | Last non-empty message (center)           | —                      |
| shaoline-segment-minor-modes   | Minor-mode icons                          | —                      |
| shaoline-segment-project-name  | Project name                              | projectile (optional)  |
| shaoline-segment-git-branch    | Current Git branch                        | vc-git                 |
| shaoline-segment-battery       | Battery percent/status                    | battery.el             |
| shaoline-segment-input-method  | Active input method                       | —                      |
| shaoline-segment-digital-clock | 24h clock (e.g. “21:43”)                  | calendar.el            |
| shaoline-segment-moon-phase    | Moon phase (icon or ASCII)                | calendar.el            |

Remove what doesn’t serve you.  
True enlightenment is lighter than a feather.

* Integrations & Custom Segments

Shaoline works seamlessly with /Flycheck/, /Evil/, and more. Add your own segments as you wish.

** Evil-mode  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(shaoline-define-simple-segment shaoline-segment-evil-state
  "Show current evil state."
  (when (bound-and-true-p evil-mode)
    (propertize evil-state 'face 'shaoline-mode-face)))
#+end_src

** Flycheck  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(shaoline-define-simple-segment shaoline-segment-flycheck
  "Show Flycheck errors/warnings."
  (when (bound-and-true-p flycheck-mode)
    (let ((err (flycheck-count-errors flycheck-current-errors)))
      (propertize
       (format "E:%d W:%d"
               (or (cdr (assq 'error   err)) 0)
               (or (cdr (assq 'warning err)) 0))
       'face 'shaoline-modified-face))))
#+end_src

More examples are in =examples/custom-segments.el=.

* Message Persistence & "Always-visible" Option

By default, the center segment shows the latest non-empty user message, even if =message= is called.  
To have classic behavior (Shaoline disappears for other messages):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq shaoline-always-visible nil)
#+end_src

User messages persist until a new non-empty arrives or ~(message nil)~ is issued.

* Write Your Own Segment

A segment is simply a function returning a string (without side-effects):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(shaoline-define-segment shaoline-segment-buffer-size (buffer)
  "Return buffer size in KiB."
  (format "%.1f KiB" (/ (buffer-size buffer) 1024.0)))
(push 'shaoline-segment-buffer-size (alist-get :right shaoline-segments))
#+end_src

Side-effects are karmic debt; avoid them.

* FAQ — Frequently Asked Koans

1. /Where did my old mode-line go?/  
   Set shaoline-autohide-modeline to nil to restore it.
2. /Why does Shaoline vanish when I run M-x?/  
   Minibuffer speaks, Shaoline waits silently.
3. /Can I use Doom icons?/  
   Yes: =all-the-icons= is used if installed.
4. /High CPU?/  
   Usually another package is spamming messages, or too many dynamic segments on a slow machine. Enable shaoline-debug to check /shaoline-logs/.
5. /Does it work in TTY?/  
   Yes—icons vanish, moon becomes ASCII, tranquility stays.
6. /Center message persists!/  
   Until a new non-empty arrives; clear with (message nil).
7. /Multi-line messages?/  
   First line + [more] indicator; full content shown briefly in the echo area.
8. /How to force Shaoline always visible?/  
   Set shaoline-always-visible = t.

* Troubleshooting

| Symptom               | Possible Cause                                    | Solution / Test                         |
|-----------------------+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------|
| Flicker               | Another package messaging rapidly                 | (setq shaoline-debug t) – see /shaoline-logs/   |
| No right segment      | Window too narrow                                 | Widen or adjust shaoline-right-padding  |
| Battery “N/A”         | No battery detected                               | Hide segment or accept impermanence     |
| Center doesn’t update | No new non-empty messages                         | (message nil) to clear                  |
| Modeline not visible  | shaoline-always-visible = nil, waiting for timeout| Set shaoline-always-visible = t         |
